I'm playing around with **_LOGSTASH_** and **_ElasticSearch_**. I already know about
ElasticSearch, this is ust learning the integration with LogStash. I'm using
Santori website to get streaming data from the net and into the ElasticSearch
instance. In this case, I'm using wiki data.

I've used **_Kafka_** as well. Grab the wiki data, queue it to Kafka, and use
LogStash as the queue for loading into ElasticSearch.

Nothing here is earth shattering. Again, it's just a playground.

Here is the Santori website: https://www.satori.com/
